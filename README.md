# JNS_Bedbugs
My version of iGEM Breaking Bugs project for epidemiology study

Try to create a good model of bedbug infestation of a room that mimicks (approximately) population dynamics.
This model will then be adapted to include *Beauveria bassiana* infection and the effects of different control
strategies.

The model should include the daily behaviour pattern of the bedbugs, the population structure and the nest/shelter
distribution structure. As much of the behaviour as possible should be documented and undocumented decisions on
bedbug behaviour and population dynamics indicated.
